Chess Move Calculator Application

Description:
The application calculates the possible moves for both colors or, based on choice, only one color. Input is the so-called 'FEN' (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string which represents a valid chess position.
In FEN strings, each rank should be separated by '/' and there should be exactly 8 ranks as there are 8 rows on the chessboard.
Amount of empty squares are represented by numbers 1-8, and pieces are represented by letters as follows:

-------------------------------
                White   Black
-------------------------------
| ♔ King ♚   |   K   |   k   |
| ♕ Queen ♛  |   Q   |   q   |
| ♖ Rook ♜   |   R   |   r   |
| ♗ Bishop ♝ |   B   |   b   |
| ♘ Knight ♞ |   N   |   n   |
| ♙ Pawn ♟   |   P   |   p   |
-------------------------------

The starting position can be expressed in simplified FEN format as follows: "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR"
The full FEN format, in addition to the piece placement, also contains the active color (who moves next), the castling rights, the possible en-passant targets, and the halfmove clock and fullmove number in separate parts: "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1"

Usage:
In IDE:                         put <FEN_STRING> as first and only argument (if neither `w` nor `b` is provided as active color, the application calculates moves for both colors)
From console w/ build:          `mvn clean package`, or `mvn clean package -Pfat-jar` to build a jar file with all dependencies as well, and then type `java -jar <JAR_FILE_NAME> "<FEN_STRING>"` in the target folder
From console w/out build:       type `java -cp target\classes com.chessmove.application.ChessMoveCalculator "<FEN_STRING>"` in the root folder

Arguments:
<FEN_STRING>:   The FEN notation of the chess board position and other relevant settings (when entering, just simply put an '-' to the unknown settings).
                Parts of FEN are:
                    1. piece placement: e.g., rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4pP2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R3K2R
                    2. active player's color: w or b (white or black), or "-"
                    3. castling rights: K and/or Q for white, k and/or q for black, or "-"
                    4. en-passant target: e6 (any en-passant target field), or "-"
                    5. halfmove clock: 0 (any number), or "-"
                    6. fullmove number: 0 (any number), or "-"

Please note the following:
- if you do not enter any parameters other than the place piecement, or all are marked with a hyphen ("-"), then the application uses a simplified display.
- The application automatically declares a draw based on
    A. 50-move rule (no capture has been made and no pawn has been moved in the last fifty moves) or
    B. extended automatic draw rule (if only two kings, or two kings and not more than one bishop or one knight on both kings sides, left on board).

An example:
"rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4pP2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq e6 0 3"
or
"rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4pP2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R3K2R - - - - -"
or
"rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4pP2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R3K2R"
